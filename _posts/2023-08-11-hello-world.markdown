# Hello and welcome to my blog!

Here you'll find updates on my various coding projects. The goal is to share what I learn so that I can learn it even better (yes this is super selfish :p)
It should be mainly about Unity, virtual reality and serious gaming. I'm also dabbling into AI recently so expect to see quite a lot of posts about deep learning. I'm not super good at talking about myself (not ideal for a blog I know) so let's wrap it up. 
See you on my next post !
